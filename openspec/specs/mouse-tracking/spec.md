# Mouse Tracking System

## Purpose

Provide interactive mouse tracking that creates dynamic visual effects and enhances user engagement through cursor-based interactions, making the portfolio feel more responsive and alive while maintaining optimal performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Mouse Position Tracking
The system SHALL track mouse position within content area boundaries.

#### Scenario: Cursor position monitoring
- **WHEN** user moves mouse within page content
- **THEN** mouse coordinates shall be captured in real-time
- **AND** position shall be constrained to content area boundaries
- **AND** tracking shall update at 60fps using requestAnimationFrame

#### Scenario: Boundary constraint enforcement
- **WHEN** mouse moves outside designated content area
- **THEN** tracking coordinates shall be clamped to area boundaries
- **AND** visual effects shall remain within content area
- **AND** smooth transitions shall occur at boundaries

### Requirement: Background Parallax Effect
The system SHALL create parallax background movement based on mouse position.

#### Scenario: Parallax movement calculation
- **WHEN** user moves mouse across the page
- **THEN** background elements shall move in opposite direction
- **AND** movement strength shall be configurable (default: 370px)
- **AND** parallax effect shall be smooth and natural

#### Scenario: Dynamic CSS variable updates
- **WHEN** mouse position changes
- **THEN** CSS custom properties --x and --y shall be updated
- **AND** --size property shall be calculated based on movement
- **AND** CSS transitions shall use updated values for effects

### Requirement: Visual Cursor Effects
The system SHALL provide visual feedback through cursor-based effects.

#### Scenario: Glow or spotlight effect
- **WHEN** mouse moves over content
- **THEN** subtle glow or spotlight shall follow cursor
- **AND** effect intensity shall vary based on mouse speed
- **AND** smooth transitions shall occur during movement

#### Scenario: Interactive element highlighting
- **WHEN** mouse hovers over interactive elements
- **THEN** additional visual enhancement shall be applied
- **AND** effect shall combine with mouse tracking
- **AND** element-specific animations may be triggered

### Requirement: Performance Optimization
The system SHALL maintain optimal performance during mouse tracking.

#### Scenario: High-frequency updates
- **WHEN** mouse moves rapidly
- **THEN** tracking shall maintain 60fps update rate
- **AND** requestAnimationFrame shall be used for efficiency
- **AND** DOM updates shall be minimized

#### Scenario: Memory and CPU efficiency
- **WHEN** mouse tracking is active
- **THEN** memory usage shall remain stable
- **AND** CPU usage shall not exceed reasonable limits
- **AND** garbage collection shall be properly managed

### Requirement: Mobile Device Compatibility
The system SHALL handle mobile devices appropriately.

#### Scenario: Mobile device detection
- **WHEN** site loads on mobile device
- **THEN** mouse tracking shall be automatically disabled
- **AND** touch interactions shall be used instead
- **AND** performance shall be optimized for mobile

#### Scenario: Touch interaction adaptation
- **WHEN** user interacts on touch device
- **THEN** equivalent visual effects shall be triggered by touch
- **AND** touch position shall be used for similar effects
- **AND** interactions shall be touch-optimized

### Requirement: Configuration and Customization
The system SHALL provide configurable parameters for mouse tracking effects.

#### Scenario: Movement strength adjustment
- **WHEN** customizing mouse tracking behavior
- **THEN** movement strength shall be configurable
- **AND** effect intensity shall be adjustable
- **AND** different presets shall be available

#### Scenario: Effect type selection
- **WHEN** choosing visual effects
- **THEN** multiple effect types shall be available
- **AND** effects shall be easily interchangeable
- **AND** custom effects shall be supported

### Requirement: Accessibility Considerations
The system SHALL respect user accessibility preferences.

#### Scenario: Reduced motion preference
- **WHEN** user has reduced motion preference enabled
- **THEN** mouse tracking effects shall be disabled or simplified
- **AND** essential functionality shall remain accessible
- **AND** user settings shall be detected and respected

#### Scenario: Visual impairment accommodation
- **WHEN** users may have visual sensitivities
- **THEN** effect intensity shall be adjustable
- **AND** effects shall not cause discomfort
- **AND** option to disable effects shall be available

### Requirement: Cross-browser Compatibility
The system SHALL work consistently across modern browsers.

#### Scenario: Browser-specific optimization
- **WHEN** running in different browsers
- **THEN** mouse tracking shall work consistently
- **AND** performance shall be optimized per browser
- **AND** fallbacks shall be provided for older browsers

#### Scenario: Feature detection and fallbacks
- **WHEN** required APIs are not available
- **THEN** graceful degradation shall occur
- **AND** alternative effects shall be provided
- **AND** functionality shall remain accessible

### Requirement: Integration with Other Systems
The system SHALL integrate seamlessly with other animation and interaction systems.

#### Scenario: Combined with scroll animations
- **WHEN** user both scrolls and moves mouse
- **THEN** effects shall combine harmoniously
- **AND** performance shall remain optimal
- **AND** visual conflicts shall be avoided

#### Scenario: Integration with portfolio interactions
- **WHEN** mouse hovers over portfolio items
- **THEN** mouse tracking shall enhance existing effects
- **AND** portfolio animations shall be enhanced
- **AND** user experience shall be cohesive
