# Accordion Layout System

## Purpose

Provide a unique horizontal accordion navigation experience with expandable pages and smooth transitions that differentiates the portfolio from traditional layouts while maintaining optimal performance and accessibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Desktop Accordion Navigation
The system SHALL provide a horizontal accordion layout with 80px collapsed page previews on desktop screens (960px and above).

#### Scenario: User expands page from collapsed state
- **WHEN** user clicks on a collapsed page preview (80px width)
- **THEN** the page shall expand smoothly to full width with animation
- **AND** other pages shall collapse to 80px width
- **AND** the page content shall be fully visible and interactive

#### Scenario: User navigates between pages
- **WHEN** user clicks on a different collapsed page
- **THEN** the current expanded page shall collapse to 80px
- **AND** the newly selected page shall expand smoothly
- **AND** scroll position shall adjust to keep expanded page in view

### Requirement: Mobile Responsive Layout
The system SHALL transform to vertical scroll layout on mobile devices (below 960px breakpoint).

#### Scenario: Mobile layout activation
- **WHEN** screen width is below 960px
- **THEN** accordion functionality shall be disabled
- **AND** pages shall display as full-width vertical sections
- **AND** normal vertical scrolling shall be enabled

#### Scenario: Desktop layout restoration
- **WHEN** screen width expands to 960px or above
- **THEN** accordion layout shall be restored
- **AND** previously active page shall remain expanded
- **AND** horizontal accordion navigation shall be re-enabled

### Requirement: State Management
The system SHALL maintain single active page state across all viewports.

#### Scenario: Active page persistence
- **WHEN** user switches between mobile and desktop layouts
- **THEN** active page shall be maintained
- **AND** page content shall remain accessible in both layouts
- **AND** navigation state shall be consistent

#### Scenario: Page initialization
- **WHEN** application loads
- **THEN** a default page shall be expanded
- **AND** other pages shall be collapsed to 80px
- **AND** system shall be ready for user interaction

### Requirement: Smooth Animations
The system SHALL provide smooth transitions for all accordion state changes.

#### Scenario: Page expansion animation
- **WHEN** page expands from collapsed to full width
- **THEN** animation shall run at 60fps
- **AND** transition shall complete within 300ms
- **AND** content shall fade in smoothly during expansion

#### Scenario: Page collapse animation
- **WHEN** page collapses from full to 80px width
- **THEN** animation shall be smooth and reversible
- **AND** preview elements shall remain visible
- **AND** no visual artifacts shall appear during transition

### Requirement: Content Visibility
The system SHALL manage content visibility based on page expansion state.

#### Scenario: Expanded page content
- **WHEN** page is expanded to full width
- **THEN** all page content shall be visible and interactive
- **AND** scrolling within page shall be enabled if needed
- **AND** all interactive elements shall be functional

#### Scenario: Collapsed page preview
- **WHEN** page is collapsed to 80px width
- **THEN** only preview content shall be visible
- **AND** full page content shall be hidden
- **AND** page title and preview image shall be displayed

### Requirement: Keyboard Navigation
The system SHALL support keyboard navigation for accessibility compliance.

#### Scenario: Tab navigation through pages
- **WHEN** user presses Tab key
- **THEN** focus shall move through interactive elements sequentially
- **AND** collapsed pages shall be included in navigation order
- **AND** focus indicators shall be clearly visible

#### Scenario: Page expansion with keyboard
- **WHEN** user presses Enter or Space on focused page
- **THEN** page shall expand as if clicked
- **AND** focus shall move to first interactive element in expanded page
- **AND** screen reader announcements shall be triggered

### Requirement: Performance Optimization
The system SHALL maintain 60fps performance during all accordion operations.

#### Scenario: Multiple rapid clicks
- **WHEN** user clicks rapidly on different pages
- **THEN** animations shall not queue or conflict
- **AND** only the most recent selection shall be processed
- **AND** performance shall remain smooth

#### Scenario: Large content pages
- **WHEN** expanded page contains extensive content
- **THEN** animation performance shall not degrade
- **AND** memory usage shall remain reasonable
- **AND** scrolling performance shall be smooth
