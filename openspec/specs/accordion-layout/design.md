# Accordion Layout Design

Technical design decisions and implementation patterns for the horizontal accordion layout system.

## Context

The accordion layout is the core navigation pattern of the HR Portfolio, providing a unique horizontal scrolling experience where pages expand from 80px previews to full-width content areas. This design decision creates visual impact and differentiates the portfolio from traditional layouts.

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain 60fps performance during animations
- Responsive design with mobile breakpoint at 960px
- State management across viewports
- Memory efficiency for smooth transitions
- Accessibility compliance for keyboard navigation

### Stakeholder Requirements
- Unique visual presentation for portfolio differentiation
- Smooth, professional animations
- Mobile-friendly alternative
- Accessible navigation for all users

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- Provide unique, memorable navigation experience
- Maintain 60fps performance on all devices
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Create smooth, professional animations
- Support both desktop and mobile layouts

### Non-Goals
- Complex multi-level navigation
- Drag-and-drop page reordering
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced customization options

## Decisions

### Decision: Single State Management
**What**: Use a single `activePageId` state to control which page is expanded

**Why**:
- Simplifies state management and reduces complexity
- Prevents multiple pages being expanded simultaneously
- Makes animations predictable and controllable
- Reduces memory usage and improves performance

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const [activePageId, setActivePageId] = useState<string>('home');
```

### Decision: CSS Transform-based Animations
**What**: Use CSS transforms and transitions for accordion animations

**Why**:
- GPU accelerated for better performance
- Smoother animations than JavaScript-based solutions
- Better battery life on mobile devices
- Simpler code and easier maintenance

**Implementation**:
```css
.page {
  transform: translateX(var(--page-offset));
  transition: transform 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}
```

### Decision: Responsive Breakpoint at 960px
**What**: Switch from accordion to vertical layout at 960px breakpoint

**Why**:
- Provides optimal experience for tablet and mobile devices
- Accordion less usable on smaller screens
- Maintains content accessibility on all devices
- Balances visual impact with usability

**Implementation**:
```css
@media (max-width: 959px) {
  .accordion-container {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

### Decision: requestAnimationFrame for Mouse Tracking
**What**: Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth mouse position updates

**Why**:
- Ensures 60fps update rate
- Prevents layout thrashing
- Optimizes browser rendering pipeline
- Provides smooth visual effects

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const updateMousePosition = useCallback(() => {
  // Update CSS custom properties
  requestAnimationFrame(updateMousePosition);
}, []);
```

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk: Performance on Low-end Devices
**Risk**: Animations may be slow on older devices

**Mitigation**:
- Feature detection for performance capabilities
- Reduced animation complexity on detected slow devices
- CSS `will-change` property for optimization
- Fallback to simpler animations when needed

### Trade-off: Complexity vs. Uniqueness
**Trade-off**: Accordion layout adds complexity but provides unique experience

**Decision**: Accept complexity for portfolio differentiation value
- Well-documented implementation patterns
- Modular component design for maintainability
- Comprehensive testing for reliability

### Risk: Accessibility Challenges
**Risk**: Complex layout may be challenging for screen readers

**Mitigation**:
- Proper ARIA labels and landmarks
- Keyboard navigation support
- Skip links for easy navigation
- Screen reader testing and optimization

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Core Layout Implementation
1. Create basic accordion structure with HTML/CSS
2. Implement expand/collapse functionality
3. Add basic state management
4. Test responsive breakpoint behavior

### Phase 2: Animation and Interactions
1. Implement smooth CSS transitions
2. Add mouse tracking integration
3. Create hover effects and micro-interactions
4. Optimize performance with GPU acceleration

### Phase 3: Accessibility and Polish
1. Add keyboard navigation support
2. Implement ARIA labels and landmarks
3. Test with screen readers
4. Optimize for mobile devices

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
1. Integrate with other page components
2. Cross-browser compatibility testing
3. Performance optimization
4. User acceptance testing

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should we add haptic feedback on mobile devices?
- [ ] Do we need to support RTL languages?
- [ ] Should we implement page reordering functionality?
- [ ] Do we need advanced animation customization options?

## Performance Considerations

### Animation Optimization
- Use CSS transforms for layout changes
- Implement `will-change` property judiciously
- Avoid layout thrashing during animations
- Optimize paint complexity

### Memory Management
- Clean up event listeners on component unmount
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper state cleanup
- Monitor memory usage during development

### Mobile Optimization
- Reduce animation complexity on mobile
- Optimize touch event handling
- Implement proper touch feedback
- Consider battery usage implications
