# Admin System Design

Technical design for the portfolio management admin system with authentication, CRUD operations, and file management.

## Context

The admin system provides content management capabilities for the HR Portfolio, allowing administrators to create, edit, and delete portfolio projects. The system uses localStorage for data persistence and React Admin for the user interface.

### Technical Constraints
- Client-side only implementation (no server backend)
- localStorage for data persistence with quota limitations
- Base64 encoding for file storage
- React Admin framework integration
- Must handle file upload size limitations

### Stakeholder Requirements
- Easy-to-use content management interface
- Secure authentication system
- File upload capabilities for images and videos
- Data backup and restore functionality
- Mobile-friendly admin interface

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- Provide intuitive content management interface
- Ensure secure authentication and session management
- Support file uploads with proper validation
- Maintain data integrity and backup capabilities
- Create responsive admin interface for all devices

### Non-Goals
- Multi-user collaboration features
- Advanced permission systems
- Real-time data synchronization
- External API integrations
- Advanced media management features

## Decisions

### Decision: localStorage-based Data Persistence
**What**: Use browser localStorage for all data storage

**Why**:
- No server infrastructure required
- Instant data persistence and retrieval
- Works offline and has good performance
- Simplifies deployment and hosting
- No external dependencies for data storage

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const saveToLocalStorage = (key: string, data: any) => {
  try {
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(data));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to save to localStorage:', error);
  }
};
```

### Decision: Base64 File Encoding
**What**: Convert uploaded files to base64 strings for storage

**Why**:
- No need for external file storage
- Files stored directly in localStorage
- Simplifies backup and restore functionality
- No server-side processing required
- Works offline

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const fileToBase64 = (file: File): Promise<string> => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);
    reader.onload = () => resolve(reader.result as string);
    reader.onerror = error => reject(error);
  });
};
```

### Decision: React Admin Framework
**What**: Use React Admin for the admin interface

**Why**:
- Provides comprehensive admin interface components
- Built-in CRUD operations and forms
- Material-UI integration for consistent design
- Accessibility features included
- Reduces development time significantly

**Implementation**:
```typescript
import { Admin, Resource, ListGuesser } from 'react-admin';

const App = () => (
  <Admin dataProvider={localStorageDataProvider} authProvider={authProvider}>
    <Resource name="projects" list={ListGuesser} />
  </Admin>
);
```

### Decision: Simple Session-based Authentication
**What**: Implement localStorage-based session management

**Why**:
- Sufficient for single-user admin system
- No server-side authentication required
- 24-hour session timeout provides reasonable security
- Simple implementation and maintenance
- Works well with localStorage data provider

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const authProvider = {
  login: ({ username, password }) => {
    // Validate credentials and create session
    const session = { user: username, expires: Date.now() + 24*60*60*1000 };
    localStorage.setItem('auth', JSON.stringify(session));
    return Promise.resolve();
  },
  // ... other auth methods
};
```

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk: localStorage Quota Limitations
**Risk**: Browser localStorage has limited storage capacity (typically 5-10MB)

**Mitigation**:
- Implement file size validation (5MB images, 50MB videos)
- Provide data export/import functionality for backup
- Monitor storage usage and provide warnings
- Implement data cleanup utilities

### Risk: Security Considerations
**Risk**: Client-side storage and authentication have security limitations

**Mitigation**:
- Implement session timeout mechanism
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Implement proper logout functionality
- Avoid storing sensitive information in localStorage

### Trade-off: Simplicity vs. Features
**Trade-off**: Client-side only implementation simplifies deployment but limits features

**Decision**: Accept limitations for simplicity and reliability
- Focus on core content management features
- Provide excellent user experience for supported features
- Document limitations clearly
- Plan for future server migration if needed

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Authentication System
1. Implement basic login/logout functionality
2. Create session management with timeout
3. Add protected route handling
4. Test authentication flows

### Phase 2: Data Provider Implementation
1. Create localStorage data provider
2. Implement CRUD operations for projects
3. Add data validation and error handling
4. Test data persistence and retrieval

### Phase 3: File Upload System
1. Implement file upload with size validation
2. Add base64 encoding for file storage
3. Create image/video preview functionality
4. Test file upload and display

### Phase 4: Admin Interface
1. Set up React Admin framework
2. Create project management interface
3. Implement forms and validation
4. Add responsive design for mobile

### Phase 5: Backup and Restore
1. Implement data export functionality
2. Create data import and restore
3. Add data validation for imports
4. Test backup and restore flows

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should we implement data compression for localStorage?
- [ ] Do we need multiple admin users with different permissions?
- [ ] Should we add revision history for projects?
- [ ] Do we need automated backup functionality?

## Performance Considerations

### localStorage Optimization
- Implement data compression if needed
- Clean up unused data regularly
- Monitor storage quota usage
- Implement efficient data structures

### File Upload Optimization
- Compress images before encoding
- Implement progressive loading for large files
- Use appropriate image formats
- Provide upload progress feedback

### React Admin Optimization
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Optimize form validation
- Cache frequently accessed data

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate file types and sizes
- Implement proper error handling
- Avoid XSS vulnerabilities

### Authentication Security
- Use secure session management
- Implement proper logout
- Validate session on each request
- Handle session expiration gracefully

### File Upload Security
- Validate file types and contents
- Implement size restrictions
- Scan for malicious content
- Use secure file handling practices
