# Add Rich Text Editor for Project Details

## Overview

Enhance the admin interface with a rich text editor specifically for project descriptions, enabling administrators to create sophisticated, formatted content with professional typography, tables, lists, and other rich elements that will be rendered using react-markdown in the portfolio detail pages.

## Scope and Impact

### Primary Scope
- Add rich text editing capability to project description fields in admin interface
- Implement preview functionality showing how content will render with react-markdown
- Maintain compatibility with existing data structure and display components
- Support professional content creation features (tables, lists, formatting, links)

### Secondary Scope
- Update admin UI to integrate rich text editor seamlessly
- Add toolbar with common formatting options
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for rich text editing
- Provide help documentation for using rich text features

### Impact Assessment
- **High Impact**: Dramatically improves content creation experience for administrators
- **Medium Complexity**: Requires integration of rich text editor library
- **Low Risk**: Backwards compatible with existing data structure
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing projects continue to work normally

## Change Relationships

### Prerequisites
- Existing admin system authentication and data management
- Current react-markdown rendering in PortfolioDetailPage component
- Established project data structure in portfolio.ts

### Dependencies
- Rich text editor library integration (e.g., react-quill, tiptap, or similar)
- react-markdown for consistent frontend rendering
- Material-UI integration for admin interface

### Sequencing
1. Select and integrate rich text editor library
2. Update admin forms to use rich text editor for description fields
3. Add preview functionality
4. Test with existing projects and new content creation
5. Validate rendering consistency between admin preview and frontend display

## Architecture Discussion

### Technical Considerations
- **Editor Library Choice**: Balance between feature richness and bundle size
- **Data Format**: Store content as Markdown or HTML - Markdown preferred for consistency
- **Preview Rendering**: Use same react-markdown configuration as frontend
- **Mobile Experience**: Ensure rich text editor works well on touch devices
- **Performance**: Minimize impact on admin interface loading times

### Integration Approach
- Replace plain text inputs with rich text editor components
- Maintain existing validation and error handling patterns
- Preserve current data flow to localStorage
- Add optional preview mode alongside editor

### User Experience
- Provide toolbar with common formatting options (bold, italic, lists, links, tables)
- Show live preview of formatted content
- Include help tooltips for advanced features
- Maintain responsive design for mobile admin access
