## Dependencies & Blocking Items

### Required Dependencies
- Existing App.tsx page configuration
- Current CSS animation system
- Existing navigation components
- Current page component implementations

### Potential Blockers
- CSS positioning dependencies that break with reordering
- Navigation components that assume specific page positions
- Animation timing conflicts in CSS
- State management issues with page order changes

### Risk Mitigation
- CSS `:nth-child` selectors are position-based and should adapt automatically
- Page components are unchanged and should work with new order
- Animation system designed for flexibility with position changes
- Comprehensive testing plan in place to catch issues early
