# Import Markdown Files

## Why

The current admin system requires manual copy-paste of markdown content, which is inefficient and prone to formatting loss. Users often maintain project documentation in external markdown files and need a streamlined way to import this content into the portfolio management system. This enhancement will significantly improve the content migration workflow and reduce the potential for formatting errors.

## Overview

Add markdown file import functionality to the admin system's rich text editor, enabling users to import existing markdown files directly into project descriptions, with validation, preview, and seamless integration into the existing workflow.

## User Story

As a portfolio admin, I want to import existing markdown files into project descriptions so that I can easily migrate content from other sources and maintain consistency with my existing documentation workflow.

## Context

### Current State
The admin system currently provides a rich text editor using `@uiw/react-md-editor` for project descriptions with:
- Manual text input and editing
- Real-time markdown preview
- Character counting and validation
- Markdown syntax help
- Auto-save functionality

### Problem Addressed
- Manual copy-paste from markdown files is tedious and error-prone
- Formatting can be lost during copy-paste operations
- No direct way to import structured markdown documents
- Time-consuming to migrate existing content from external markdown files

### Integration Points
- Extends the existing `RichTextDescriptionEditor` component
- Leverages current file upload patterns from image/video handling
- Integrates with existing validation and error handling systems
- Maintains Material-UI design consistency

## Success Criteria

- Users can successfully import .md files into the project description editor
- Imported content maintains proper markdown formatting and structure
- File validation prevents malicious or oversized files
- Preview functionality shows imported content before confirming
- Existing editor functionality remains unchanged
- Import integrates seamlessly with auto-save and validation systems
- Mobile-friendly file selection interface

## Constraints

- Must maintain existing localStorage-based data persistence
- File size limits consistent with current upload constraints
- Client-side processing only (no external file processing services)
- Must work within existing Material-UI theme and design patterns
- No impact on existing admin system performance

## Dependencies

- Existing `RichTextDescriptionEditor` component
- Current file upload infrastructure in `fileUtils`
- React Admin form validation system
- Material-UI component library
- `@uiw/react-md-editor` for markdown processing

## Related Work

References existing admin system specifications and file upload patterns established in:
- `admin-system` spec for file upload requirements
- Current image/video file handling patterns
- Existing markdown editor validation system

## Out of Scope

- Import of other file formats (docx, txt, etc.)
- Export functionality (separate consideration)
- Bulk import of multiple markdown files
- Server-side file processing or storage
- External markdown file hosting integration
