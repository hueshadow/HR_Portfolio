- [x] Mobile devices fully supported with responsive design
- [x] Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) compliance
- [x] No memory leaks during file processing
- [x] Graceful degradation when JavaScript fails

### Integration Requirements
- [x] Seamless integration with existing React Admin forms
- [x] Auto-save functionality works with imported content
- [x] Error handling follows existing patterns

- [x] File upload patterns consistent with image/video uploads

## Dependencies & Blocking Items

### Required Dependencies
- Existing `RichTextDescriptionEditor` component
- Current `fileUtils.ts` infrastructure
- React Admin form validation system
- Material-UI component library

### Potential Blockers
- Large file processing performance issues
- Mobile file picker compatibility problems
- Security vulnerabilities in markdown processing
